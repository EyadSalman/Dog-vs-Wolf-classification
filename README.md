# 🐶🐺 Dog vs Wolf Image Classification

This project tackles the binary classification problem of distinguishing between **dogs** and **wolves** using deep learning. We explore and compare multiple convolutional neural network architectures — from a custom-built **Simple CNN** to powerful **transfer learning models** like **ResNet50**, **EfficientNetB0**, and **MobileNetV2**.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of two labeled image folders:
